Anyone may contribute to the repo, make a fork and when youre done writing your code open a pull request.

When writing code, please make sure you follow the code style of the project, and the general structure. Include any non plugin files (i.e. editor files) in your gitignore.

In general, follow normal gitflow styles and use common sense.
